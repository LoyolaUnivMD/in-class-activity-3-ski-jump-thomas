1. Make a new scanner object called in
2. output "Is the hill a normal or large hill? "
3. set hill_type to the input
4. set height as an int = 46
5. set points_per_meter as a double = 2
6. set par as an int = 90
7. if hill_type == "large"
    i. set height to 70
    ii. set points_per_meter = 1.8
    iii. set par = 120
8. output "What was the speed at the end of the ramp? "
9. make a new int called speed and set it to the input
10. set double time = 2*height divided by 9.8, then square rooted
11. set double distance = speed * time
12. set double points = 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter
13. if points >= 61
    i. output "Great job for doing better than par!"
14. else if points < 10
    i. output "What happened?"
15. else
    i. output "Sorry you didnâ€™t go very far"
16. output "You went "+ distance + "far and got "+ points+  "points!"
